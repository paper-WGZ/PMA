# Phase and Magnitude Alignment (PMA)

PMA: a novel method for time series alignment and distance measure. 

* PMA aligns time series through segment-to-segment matching, making it robust to local phase and magnitude variations. 

* PMA separately measures phase and magnitude differences, while providing shape distance invariant to local scaling and shifting through segment-wise alignment. 

## Requirements

1. Install Python 3.8, and the required dependencies.
2. Required dependencies can be installed by: ```pip install -r requirements.txt```
